# UTC-Zulu-Time-Converter

This Python program converts ISO 8601 UTC Zulu time format (e.g. 2020-08-27T01:00:01.000Z) to something more legible (e.g. Saturday January 04, 2020 @ 08:00PM) and displays the three major timezones in the continental U.S. I used this program's output to quickly see when a competitor's auction ended on eBay across the country to better enhance my sales.
